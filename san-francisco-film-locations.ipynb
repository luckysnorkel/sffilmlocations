I love the city dearly and am proud to call it my home. Its reputation has suffered recently, in large part due to biased national news reporting. But perhaps the news isn’t wholly to blame for this misperception.\n\nThe longer I’ve lived here, the more I’ve come to realize that the San Francisco that’s so often portrayed in films and television tends to be limited to small pockets of the city. So perhaps the average American’s media-driven perception of how San Francisco “used to be” feeds into this overblown viewpoint of a city in decline. I decided to undergo an analysis of city filming locations to answer the following questions:\n\n1. How have the number and scope of citywide filming locations changed over time?\n2. How do the most-filmed districts correlate with actual San Francisco demographics?\n3. Which titles offer the most diverse and balanced portrayals of San Francisco?\n4. How does diversity of SF portrayal correlate to the most popular and profitable films and television shows?\n\nData sources: \n* SF Film Locations: DataSF, Open data project https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am/about_data \n* SF Supervisor District Demographics: https://www.sf.gov/departments/2020-census-redistricting-task-force \n* Income data from data.census.gov \n* Film budget and popularity: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/tmdb-movies-dataset-2023-930k-movies \n\n### Data Cleaning\nThe DataSF film locations dataset required extensive cleaning prior to conducting my analysis. While extremely comprehensive, the information was messy, inconsistent, and in some cases, incomplete. I took the following steps:\n\n- Removed a handful of duplicate entries\n- Removed non-SF locations (in Marin, East Bay, South Bay -- except SF-adjacent points of interest like Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, and the Bay Bridge)\n- Thorough standardization of locations\n    - Cleaned up addresses\n        - Converted entries with intersections to addresses\n        - Converted entries with ranges of blocks to a single centered address\n        - Split out entries with multiple locations noted\n        - A few nonsensical locations deleted (ie - streets that don't intersect, streets that don't exist in the city)\n    - Corrected street and landmark misspellings (ie - “Chrissy” Field, “Delores” Park)\n    - Generated lat/long coordinates using the [Geocode for Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/geocode_for_sheets_mapping_sheets/1083994590944) plugin\n    - Adjusted location names to be uniform across multiple entries\n- Standardized film/TV titles (in the case of television shows filming across multiple episodes and/or seasons)\n- Input missing Supervisor District info where applicable\n- Renamed columns to remove spaces (for easier SQL import)\n\nI had to copy information from the 2020 redistricting report in order to build my table for SF district demographic data.\n\nA quick inspection of the film database in SQL revealed the data to be in good shape for immediate analysis.\n\n### Analysis\n#### Part I: General Film Location Stats\nMost popular filming locations\n```\nSELECT Locations,\nCOUNT(DISTINCT Title) AS n_films\nFROM film_locations_sf\nGROUP BY Locations\nORDER BY n_films DESC;\n```\n\nFilms with the most locations\n```\nSELECT Title, \nCOUNT(DISTINCT Locations) as n_locations\nFROM film_locations_sf\nGROUP BY Title\nORDER BY n_locations DESC;\n```\n\nFilms with the most “diverse” SF representation (filming locations across the most districts)\n```\nSELECT Title,\nCOUNT(DISTINCT CurrentSupervisorDistricts) as n_districts,\nCOUNT(DISTINCT Locations) AS n_locations\nFROM film_locations_sf\nGROUP BY Title\nHAVING COUNT(DISTINCT CurrentSupervisorDistricts) > 4\nORDER BY n_districts DESC, n_locations DESC;\n```\n\nFilms with the least \"diverse\" SF representation (least number of supervisor districts filmed in, relative to total number of filming locations)\n```\nSELECT Title,\nCOUNT(DISTINCT CurrentSupervisorDistricts) as n_districts,\nCOUNT(DISTINCT Locations) AS n_locations\nFROM film_locations_sf\nWHERE CurrentSupervisorDistricts IS NOT NULL\nGROUP BY Title\nHAVING COUNT(DISTINCT Locations) > 3\nORDER BY n_districts ASC, n_locations DESC;\n```\n\nNumber of films by year, director, actor, writer, production company and distributor\n```\nSELECT ReleaseYear,\nCOUNT(DISTINCT Title) AS n_films\nFROM film_locations_sf\nGROUP BY ReleaseYear;\n```\n\n```\nSELECT Director,\nCOUNT(DISTINCT Title) AS n_films\nFROM film_locations_SF\nGROUP BY Director\nORDER BY n_films DESC;\n```\n\n```\nSELECT Writer,\nCOUNT(DISTINCT Title) AS n_films\nFROM film_locations_SF\nGROUP BY Writer\nORDER BY n_films DESC;\n```\n\n```\nSELECT actor,\nCOUNT(DISTINCT Title) as n_films\nFROM\n(select actor1 AS actor,\n    Title\nfrom film_locations_SF\nUNION\nSELECT actor2 AS actor,\n    Title\nFROM film_locations_SF\nUNION\nSELECT actor3 AS actor,\n    Title\nFROM film_locations_SF) t\nWHERE actor IS NOT NULL\nGROUP BY actor\nORDER BY n_films DESC;\n```\n\n```\nSELECT productioncompany,\nCOUNT(DISTINCT Title) AS n_films\nFROM film_locations_sf\nGROUP BY productioncompany\nORDER BY n_films DESC;\n```\n\n```\nSELECT distributor,\nCOUNT(DISTINCT Title) AS n_films\nFROM film_locations_sf\nGROUP BY distributor\nORDER BY n_films DESC;\n```\n\nWhich supervisor district is the most popular for filming?
